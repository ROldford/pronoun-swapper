# pronoun-swapper package

Convert all pronouns in selected text to female or male form

To use, just select some text, then activate the femaleify or maleify commands.
* Commands are accessible from command pallete and packages menu

Currently swaps these pronoun pairs easily:
She/He
he/she
himself/herself
Her/His

The pairs her/him and her/his work fine when femaleify-ing, but maleifying is too context sensitive. (Is it the object of a word, or is it a possessive pronoun?)
Right now, it replaces "her" with "him-his". You'll have to fix it manually.
